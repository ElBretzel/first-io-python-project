You can create text files with some custom shapes in it.

I will no longer maintain the portability of the project.

## :pushpin: Personal Note
*I don't think anyone will find this project useful for their personal use. My main goal for this project was to train with I/O in Python .  

The project has very poor Pythonic content. I did not modify the project before republishing it on Github. Therefore, the code may not be maintenable.  
When I did the project, I had poor knowledge on Python. I apologize in advance for all those who will look at the code*
